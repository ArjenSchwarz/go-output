# Pipeline Visualization Requirements

## Introduction

The Pipeline Visualization feature provides comprehensive visibility into the transform pipeline operations of the go-output v2 library. This feature serves three critical purposes: generating documentation diagrams, enabling real-time debugging with actual data samples, and providing performance profiling insights. The visualization system will help developers understand data flow, identify bottlenecks, debug transformation issues, and maintain accurate documentation of their pipeline configurations.

## Requirements

### 1. Core Visualization Modes
**User Story**: As a developer, I want multiple visualization modes, so that I can use the appropriate level of detail for different scenarios.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1.1. The system SHALL provide a Documentation Mode that generates static pipeline structure diagrams
1.2. The system SHALL provide a Debug Mode that includes live data samples at each pipeline stage
1.3. The system SHALL provide a Profile Mode that displays performance metrics and resource usage
1.4. The system SHALL allow mode selection through configuration options
1.5. Each mode SHALL generate output appropriate to its purpose without requiring code changes

### 2. Data Capture and Sampling
**User Story**: As a developer debugging issues, I want to see actual data samples at each pipeline stage, so that I can understand how transformations affect my data.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
2.1. The system SHALL capture configurable sample sizes at each transformation stage
2.2. The system SHALL preserve data samples without modifying the original pipeline flow
2.3. The system SHALL support capturing samples from large datasets without memory issues
2.4. The system SHALL include input and output record counts for each stage
2.5. The system SHALL capture error states and failed transformations

### 3. Performance Metrics Collection
**User Story**: As a performance engineer, I want detailed metrics for each pipeline stage, so that I can identify and optimize bottlenecks.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
3.1. The system SHALL measure execution time for each transformation stage
3.2. The system SHALL track memory usage changes at each stage
3.3. The system SHALL record CPU utilization for each transformer
3.4. The system SHALL identify the slowest stages in the pipeline
3.5. The system SHALL provide aggregated statistics for multiple pipeline runs

### 4. Output Format Support
**User Story**: As a developer, I want multiple output formats for visualizations, so that I can use them in different contexts.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
4.1. The system SHALL generate Mermaid diagrams for markdown documentation
4.2. The system SHALL produce interactive HTML visualizations for debugging
4.3. The system SHALL support DOT format for Graphviz rendering
4.4. The system SHALL provide JSON output for programmatic analysis
4.5. The system SHALL allow custom output format extensions

### 5. Integration with Transform Pipeline
**User Story**: As a library user, I want seamless integration with the existing transform pipeline, so that I can enable visualization without restructuring my code.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
5.1. The system SHALL integrate through functional options pattern (WithPipelineVisualizer)
5.2. The system SHALL NOT impact pipeline performance when visualization is disabled
5.3. The system SHALL support enabling/disabling visualization at runtime
5.4. The system SHALL maintain thread-safety during concurrent operations
5.5. The system SHALL preserve the immutability guarantees of the v2 architecture

### 6. Interactive Debugging Features
**User Story**: As a developer troubleshooting issues, I want interactive visualization features, so that I can explore data at different pipeline stages.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
6.1. The interactive view SHALL allow clicking on stages to see full data samples
6.2. The interactive view SHALL display statistics on hover
6.3. The interactive view SHALL support searching within captured samples
6.4. The interactive view SHALL highlight anomalies or unexpected patterns
6.5. The interactive view SHALL allow filtering samples by criteria

### 7. Comparative Analysis
**User Story**: As an optimization engineer, I want to compare different pipeline configurations, so that I can choose the most efficient approach.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
7.1. The system SHALL support comparing two or more pipeline configurations
7.2. The comparison SHALL display side-by-side performance metrics
7.3. The comparison SHALL highlight differences in data flow
7.4. The comparison SHALL identify relative bottlenecks
7.5. The comparison SHALL generate recommendations for optimization

### 8. Real-time Monitoring
**User Story**: As a DevOps engineer, I want real-time pipeline monitoring, so that I can observe production behavior.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
8.1. The system SHALL support streaming visualization updates via WebSocket
8.2. The system SHALL buffer visualization data for delayed consumption
8.3. The system SHALL provide configurable update intervals
8.4. The system SHALL support multiple concurrent monitoring sessions
8.5. The system SHALL handle connection failures gracefully

### 9. Documentation Generation
**User Story**: As a technical writer, I want automatic pipeline documentation, so that I can keep documentation synchronized with code.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
9.1. The system SHALL generate documentation-ready diagrams from actual pipeline configuration
9.2. The system SHALL include transformer descriptions in generated diagrams
9.3. The system SHALL support custom annotations for documentation
9.4. The system SHALL produce diagrams compatible with common documentation tools
9.5. The system SHALL update diagrams when pipeline configuration changes

### 10. Error and Anomaly Detection
**User Story**: As a developer, I want automatic detection of pipeline issues, so that I can identify problems quickly.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
10.1. The system SHALL highlight stages with high filter rates
10.2. The system SHALL detect unusual data patterns
10.3. The system SHALL identify memory spikes
10.4. The system SHALL flag performance degradation
10.5. The system SHALL provide alerts for configurable thresholds

## Technical Constraints

- Must maintain backward compatibility with existing v2 transform pipeline
- Must not introduce global state (following v2 architecture principles)
- Must be thread-safe for concurrent operations
- Must have minimal performance impact when disabled
- Must support Go 1.24+ features
- Must follow the functional options pattern established in v2

## Success Criteria

1. Developers can debug transformation issues 50% faster using visualization
2. Documentation stays automatically synchronized with code
3. Performance bottlenecks are identifiable within minutes
4. Zero performance impact when visualization is disabled
5. All existing v2 tests continue to pass with visualization integrated
