# Pipeline Visualization - Decision Log

## 2025-08-17: Feature Postponed

**Decision**: Pipeline visualization feature development is postponed until an improved pipeline system is implemented.

**Context**: 
- Initial idea.md envisioned a comprehensive pipeline visualization system for debugging and documentation
- Requirements were drafted based on assumptions about v2's transform pipeline architecture
- Design review revealed fundamental architectural misalignment

**Analysis**:
- The v2 architecture has minimal pipeline capabilities (only byte-level transformers on final output)
- Requirements assumed a data transformation pipeline that doesn't exist
- Current v2 flow: Document Builder → Immutable Document → Renderer → Byte Transformers
- Visualization would be more valuable with a richer pipeline system

**Root Issue**: 
The visualization feature was designed for a sophisticated transform pipeline, but v2's current "pipeline" is just simple post-processing transformers.

**Alternative Approaches Considered**:
1. Document Construction Visualization - track Builder method calls
2. Render Process Instrumentation - monitor Document → Output flow  
3. Build Pipeline System First - add real data transformation capabilities to v2

**Decision Rationale**:
- Implementing visualization for the current minimal pipeline would provide limited value
- A proper transform pipeline system would make visualization significantly more useful
- Better to build the pipeline capabilities first, then add visualization

**Next Steps**:
- Create separate discussion for improved pipeline system design
- Pipeline visualization requirements can be revisited after pipeline enhancement
- Current requirements document serves as reference for future pipeline visualization needs

**Dependencies**:
- Enhanced transform pipeline system (not yet designed)
- Data transformation capabilities beyond current byte-level transformers

**Status**: On hold pending pipeline system improvements
