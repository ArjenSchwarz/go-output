# Transformation Pipeline Enhancement Requirements

## Introduction

The transformation pipeline enhancement aims to evolve the v2 transformation system from a simple post-rendering text manipulation system to a comprehensive data transformation framework. Currently, transformers operate only on rendered bytes, limiting them to cosmetic changes. This enhancement will introduce data-level operations, format-aware transformations, and a composable pipeline architecture while maintaining complete backward compatibility with existing code.

The primary goal is to enable users to perform data operations (filtering, sorting, aggregating) directly on structured data before rendering, eliminating the need for manual data manipulation before document creation and avoiding expensive parse/render cycles.

## Requirements

### 1. Data-Level Transformation Support

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to transform data at the structural level before rendering, so that I can perform operations like filtering and sorting without parsing rendered output.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1.1. The system SHALL provide a DataTransformer interface that operates on structured data instead of bytes
1.2. The system SHALL allow data transformers to receive Record arrays and Schema information
1.3. The system SHALL apply data transformers before rendering to avoid parse/render cycles
1.4. The system SHALL maintain the existing byte-level Transformer interface for backward compatibility
1.5. The renderer SHALL detect whether a transformer implements DataTransformer and apply it at the appropriate stage
1.6. The system SHALL preserve the original document data when transformations are not applied

### 2. Format-Aware Transformation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want transformers to understand the output format context, so that I can apply format-specific transformations correctly.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
2.1. Data transformers SHALL receive the target output format as a parameter
2.2. The system SHALL allow transformers to modify behavior based on the output format
2.3. Format-specific transformers SHALL work correctly with all supported formats (JSON, YAML, CSV, HTML, Table, Markdown)
2.4. The system SHALL provide format context to both data and byte transformers
2.5. Transformers SHALL be able to declare which formats they support via CanTransform method

### 3. Pipeline API for Complex Operations

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a fluent pipeline API for chaining data operations, so that I can build complex transformations from simple, composable operations.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
3.1. The system SHALL provide a Pipeline() method on Document for initiating transformation chains

3.5. Pipeline operations SHALL be lazy-evaluated and optimized before execution
3.6. The system SHALL support custom pipeline operations through a registration mechanism

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to sort table data by one or more columns, so that I can present data in meaningful order without pre-sorting.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
5.1. The system SHALL provide Sort operations accepting column names and sort direction

5.5. The system SHALL support custom comparison functions for complex sorting
5.6. Sort operations SHALL work correctly with all table-based output formats

### 6. Aggregation Operations

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to perform aggregations like sum and count on table data, so that I can display summary information without manual calculation.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
6.1. The system SHALL provide GroupBy operations for grouping records by column values
6.2. The system SHALL support aggregation functions: Sum, Count, Average, Min, Max
6.3. Aggregations SHALL work with numeric data types appropriately
6.4. GroupBy SHALL support multiple grouping columns
6.5. The system SHALL allow custom aggregation functions
6.6. Aggregated results SHALL produce new table structures with appropriate schemas

### 7. Calculated Fields

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to add calculated columns to tables, so that I can derive new data from existing columns.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
7.1. The system SHALL provide AddColumn operations for creating new fields
7.2. Calculated fields SHALL have access to all record data for computation
7.3. The system SHALL update the schema to include new calculated fields
7.4. Calculated fields SHALL support type inference or explicit type declaration
7.5. The system SHALL maintain key order with new fields appended by default
7.6. Users SHALL be able to specify the position of new calculated fields

### 8. Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want transformation operations to have reasonable performance, so that transformations don't become a bottleneck in my data processing.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
8.1. The system SHALL optimize pipeline operations to minimize data passes where practical
8.2. Filter operations SHOULD be applied before expensive operations like sort when possible
8.3. The system MAY support parallel execution in future versions
8.4. Pipeline execution SHOULD minimize memory allocation where practical

### 9. Backward Compatibility

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance Requirements

### Compatibility Requirements
- The enhancement SHALL support Go 1.24+ features
- All transformations SHALL work with the existing v2 Document-Builder pattern

- Existing code SHALL continue to work without modification

### Future Considerations for Security (Not Required Initially)

- Resource limits and timeouts may be added if needed
- Infinite loop prevention may be implemented based on usage patterns

## Future Considerations

- Support for streaming transformations on infinite data sources
- Cross-table join operations for related data
- Window functions for time-series analysis
- Transformation caching and memoization strategies
- Visual pipeline builder tooling
- Transformation performance profiling tools
