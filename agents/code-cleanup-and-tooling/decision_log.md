# Decision Log - Code Cleanup and Tooling

## Feature Name Selection
**Date:** 2025-01-25
**Decision:** Use "code-cleanup-and-tooling" as the feature name
**Rationale:** Encompasses all three aspects of the work: code modernization, test improvements, and developer tooling

## Scope Limitation
**Date:** 2025-01-25
**Decision:** Limit all changes to v2 directory only
**Rationale:** User explicitly stated to limit everything to v2, maintaining clear separation from v1 code

## Modernization Priorities
**Date:** 2025-01-25
**Decision:** Implement all modernize tool suggestions found (118 items across multiple categories)
**Rationale:** Tool identifies objective improvements using Go 1.24+ features that improve performance and readability

## Test Organization Strategy
**Date:** 2025-01-25
**Decision:** Follow Go 2025 best practices from research document
**Key Points:**
- Use map-based table tests for better isolation
- Separate integration tests with environment variables (not build tags)
- Keep test files adjacent to source files
- Split large test files by functionality

## Makefile Design
**Date:** 2025-01-25
**Decision:** Create comprehensive Makefile with all common development commands
**Rationale:** Provides consistent, one-command access to development tasks across different environments

**Update:** fmt target must include all example directories using pattern like `for dir in v2/examples/*/; do (cd "$dir" && go fmt ./...); done`
**Rationale:** Examples should maintain consistent formatting with main codebase

## Benchmark Modernization
**Date:** 2025-01-25
**Decision:** Convert all benchmarks to use new b.Loop() pattern
**Rationale:** Go 1.24 feature that provides automatic timer management and prevents compiler optimization issues
