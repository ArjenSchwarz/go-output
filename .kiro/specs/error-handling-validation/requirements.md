# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Error Handling and Validation feature will replace the current `log.Fatal()` approach with a comprehensive error management system, providing detailed validation, recoverable errors, and actionable feedback for the go-output library. This enhancement will eliminate unexpected program termination, provide detailed error messages, and enable validation before expensive operations while maintaining backward compatibility.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want my application to handle errors gracefully without crashing, so that I can provide better user experience and maintain application stability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an error occurs in the go-output library THEN the system SHALL return an error instead of calling log.Fatal()
2. WHEN an error is returned THEN the system SHALL include detailed error information with error codes, context, and suggestions
3. WHEN backward compatibility is needed THEN the system SHALL provide a legacy mode that maintains log.Fatal() behavior
4. WHEN migrating existing code THEN the system SHALL provide helper methods that wrap new error handling with log.Fatal() behavior

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to validate configuration before processing large datasets, so that I can catch errors early and avoid wasted processing time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN validation is requested THEN the system SHALL validate OutputSettings before any processing begins
2. WHEN format-specific validation is needed THEN the system SHALL validate requirements for each output format (mermaid, dot, etc.)
3. WHEN file output is configured THEN the system SHALL validate file paths and permissions before processing
4. WHEN S3 output is configured THEN the system SHALL validate S3 configuration and credentials before processing
5. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL return detailed validation errors with specific field information

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want detailed error messages that tell me how to fix problems, so that I can quickly resolve issues without extensive debugging.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an error occurs THEN the system SHALL provide an error code for programmatic handling
2. WHEN an error occurs THEN the system SHALL include human-readable error messages
3. WHEN an error occurs THEN the system SHALL provide detailed context including field names, values, and positions
4. WHEN an error occurs THEN the system SHALL include suggested fixes and solutions
5. WHEN multiple errors exist THEN the system SHALL collect and report all validation violations together

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to choose between strict and lenient error handling, so that I can control how my application responds to different types of errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN strict mode is enabled THEN the system SHALL fail fast on any error and return immediately
2. WHEN lenient mode is enabled THEN the system SHALL continue processing on recoverable errors and collect all issues
3. WHEN lenient mode is enabled THEN the system SHALL provide partial output where possible
4. WHEN interactive mode is enabled THEN the system SHALL prompt for error resolution and offer automatic fixes
5. WHEN error handling mode is not specified THEN the system SHALL default to strict mode

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to test error conditions in my code, so that I can ensure my error handling works correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing error conditions THEN the system SHALL provide predictable error types and codes
2. WHEN testing validation THEN the system SHALL allow injection of custom validators
3. WHEN testing error handling THEN the system SHALL provide mock error handlers for testing
4. WHEN testing recovery THEN the system SHALL allow testing of recovery strategies independently

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to recover from errors and provide fallback behavior, so that my application can continue operating even when some operations fail.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a recoverable error occurs THEN the system SHALL attempt automatic recovery using configured strategies
2. WHEN format-specific errors occur THEN the system SHALL support fallback to simpler formats (table → CSV → JSON)
3. WHEN missing values are encountered THEN the system SHALL support default value substitution
4. WHEN transient errors occur THEN the system SHALL support retry with exponential backoff
5. WHEN recovery is successful THEN the system SHALL continue processing and report the recovery action

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want structured errors for monitoring and alerting, so that I can track application health and respond to issues proactively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide structured error output in JSON format
2. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL categorize errors by severity (Fatal, Error, Warning, Info)
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide error statistics and summaries
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL support integration with monitoring and logging systems
5. WHEN multiple errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide aggregated error reports with counts by category

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive data validation capabilities, so that I can ensure data quality before processing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN required columns are specified THEN the system SHALL validate that all required columns exist in the dataset
2. WHEN data types are specified THEN the system SHALL validate that column values match expected types
3. WHEN custom constraints are defined THEN the system SHALL validate data against custom business rules
4. WHEN empty datasets are encountered THEN the system SHALL handle them according to configured policy
5. WHEN malformed data is detected THEN the system SHALL provide specific information about the malformation

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want flexible error categorization, so that I can handle different types of errors appropriately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuration errors occur THEN the system SHALL categorize them with error codes 1xxx (OUT-1001, OUT-1002, etc.)
2. WHEN validation errors occur THEN the system SHALL categorize them with error codes 2xxx (OUT-2001, OUT-2002, etc.)
3. WHEN processing errors occur THEN the system SHALL categorize them with error codes 3xxx (OUT-3001, OUT-3002, etc.)
4. WHEN runtime errors occur THEN the system SHALL categorize them with error codes 4xxx (OUT-4001, OUT-4002, etc.)
5. WHEN errors are categorized THEN the system SHALL provide consistent error handling patterns for each category

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a developer, I want performance-conscious error handling, so that error management doesn't significantly impact application performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN validation is performed THEN the validation overhead SHALL be less than 1% of total processing time
2. WHEN errors are created THEN the system SHALL avoid excessive memory allocation
3. WHEN error messages are generated THEN the system SHALL use lazy evaluation to avoid unnecessary string formatting
4. WHEN multiple validators are used THEN the system SHALL optimize validation execution order
5. WHEN error context is collected THEN the system SHALL minimize performance impact of context gathering
